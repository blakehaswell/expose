                                    EXPOSE

A minimal utility for finding files, somewhat inspired by find(1).

OPTIONS

    -r      Enable recursive mode. Will recursively descend the file hierarchy
            looking for files.

    -d <directory>
            Specify the directory which will be searched. Equivilant to:
                $ cd <directory> && expose

    -e <extension>
            Find only files ending with the specified extension. You can also
            use this option to search for files with multiple extensions e.g.
                $ expose -e ".min.js"

EXAMPLES

Find all files within the current directory:
    $ expose

Recursively find all files within the current directory hierarchy:
    $ expose -r

Find all JavaScript files within the current directory:
    $ expose -e ".js"

Recursively find all files within the src directory:
    $ expose -r -d src

Recursively find all JavaScript files within the src directory:
    $ expose -r -d src -e ".js"
